## Goal

A webhook to forward GitHub and GitLab events to StreamLabs Alerts and Twitch Chat.

This is a tool created with live-coding streamers in mind. The goal is to have another source of
interaction and showcase relevant activity on GitHub to their audience on streaming platforms
generating more interest in their Open Source projects.

## Features

### GitHub

We support the following events:

- Stars
- Forks
- Releases
- Issues
  - Opened
  - Assigned
- Pull Requests
  - Opened
  - Merged

### GitLab

At the moment GitLab's webhooks don't support as many events. So far, we support:

- Merge Request
  - Opened
  - Merged

## Setup

There are a few requirements for the integration to work.

- [ ] Your webhook is on a server, running 24/7
- [ ] Your webhook is able to receive HTTP requests from GitHub/GitLab.
- [ ] Your repository (and/or user/organisation) on GitHub/GitLab is configured to notify your
      webhook

You can deploy this webhook in different ways

### Deploying to Heroku

You can use the "[deploy to Heroku](#deploy-to-heroku)" button or use the Heroku CLI

### Configuring your local repo to deploy on Heroku

- Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
- Log in to Heroku with `heroku login`
- Open the Heroku dashboard for your app
- Go to the settings tab
- Under **App Information**, copy the **Heroku git Url**
- Add a new git remote with `git remote add heroku your-https-git-repo-goes-here`

### Deploying changes to a Heroku app using the CLI

Push to the master branch on Heroku with `git push heroku master`

Note that you can deploy a different branch to Heroku, but it will only deploy the remote master branch. To deploy a
local branch you can run `git push heroku your-branch-here:master` so that your branch overrides the _master_ branch on Heroky.
